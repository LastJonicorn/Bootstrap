          Hi! My name is Joni and I'm 29 years old. That's the universal way to strat a bio, right? <br> <br>
          At the moment I am a full time student at the university of applied sciences in Oulu. 
          I'll be a full fledged coder when I graduate, which is pretty cool. <br>
          I'm truly excited about everything I've learned so far and this page made with Bootstrap is looking pretty nice!
          Besides of coding I also enjoy drawing and 3D-modeling, which is why I desided to create my very own portfolio for this assigment. <br><br>
          I've been doodling ever since I can remember but I really started to practice drawing about 10 years ago. 
          At first all I did was draw all the time. I learned about human anatomy and different lighting techiques. I was pretty obsessed...<br> 
          I've cooled down a bit since and enjoy drawing as a more casual hobby now days.<br><br>
          3D-modeling has been a pretty much opposite story compared to drawing. It started out really casual about 13 years ago 
          because the learning curve seemed so steep. Also the program that I use was really unpolished compared to what it is now.
          But as the program kept getting more and more updates, also my interest started to grow. And in the last few years I've been 
          really committed to learn everything 3D-modeling has to offer.

                        Blender is a FREE 3D-modeling software that does pretty much everything you want. It has great modeling and sculpting features
                        and really flexible materails, so you can create what ever you want. Blender's greatest flaw is that it has so musch packed 
                        in one software that you'll never learn it fully. You kinda have to choose what you want from Blender and learn that.

                        Clip studio paint is a really flexible and easy to learn 2D drawing software. You can see the inspiration it takes from industry 
                        standards like Photoshop in terms of layout. Clip studio paint does one thing and does it really well. Of course it doesn't have the 
                        diversity of Photoshop but if you are looking for digital art software, it's the one I'd recommend.

                        I do all of my 3D sculpting and modeling in Blender BUT I do almost all of my 3D sketching in VR. 
                        It's a great place to move freely around your model and think about ideas how to make it cooler. 
                        My headset is Oculus quest 2 and my modeling software for VR is ShapeLab. VR is not the greatest for finishing 
                        your models but it is a great and relaxing space to sketch.
